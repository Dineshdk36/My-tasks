        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

            CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now let’s try to break the acronym:
            
                    Cascading: Falling of Styles
                    Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
                    Sheets: Writing our style in different documents

             Selector {
                       Property 1 : value;
                                 Property 2 : value;
                                Property 3 : value;
                         }
              For example:
                     h1
                        {
                            Color: red;
                             Text-align: center;
            
                        }
                      #unique 
                       {
                             color: green;
                       }
            
            
            Selector: selects the element you want to target
            Always remains the same whether we apply internal or external styling 
            There are few basic selectors like tags, id’s, and classes
            All forms this key-value pair
            Keys: properties(attributes) like color, font-size, background, width, height,etc
            Value: values associated with these properties</p>
